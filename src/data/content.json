    "description": "I’m a <strong>full stack developer</strong>, and for me, <strong>AI</strong> has been a real turning point. My career feels divided into 'before AI' and 'after AI.' I’ve always enjoyed coding, but AI tools like <strong>Cursor</strong> and <strong>Copilot</strong> have taken what I can do to another level. I use them every day to boost productivity and push beyond my old limits. I am also interested in <strong>software architecture</strong>, <strong>automation</strong>, and writing <strong>clean, maintainable code</strong>. I frequently share insights through my <strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@caglarcansarikaya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium blog</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@caglarcansarikaya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube channel</a></strong>."
